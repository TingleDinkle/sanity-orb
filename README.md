indeed the purpose of this project is to gauge students for their input on current sanity level, from the data gathered it will then be presented as a "sanity orb" beautifully. That's the idea, at least..

and also, it's my first project to implement React-Vite, Threejs and Tailwind css to polish frontend skills
